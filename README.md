## Project Overview
This project analyzes customer churn data for a telecom company to identify key factors contributing to churn and provides actionable recommendations to improve retention. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and visualizations, the project highlights trends and customer behaviors associated with higher churn rates.

## Key Findings
- **Demographics:** Senior citizens exhibit a significantly higher churn rate (42%).
- **Contract Types:** Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate (43%) compared to one-year (11%) and two-year contracts (3%).
- **Service Usage:** Fiber-optic internet and streaming services correlate with elevated churn rates.
- **Billing Preferences:** Electronic billing and electronic check payments show higher churn rates.
- **Tenure:** New customers (tenure < 12 months) are at the highest risk of churning.

## Recommendations
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Develop targeted retention strategies for high-risk groups, such as senior citizens and month-to-month contract holders.
2. **Incentivize Long-Term Contracts:** Offer promotions to encourage month-to-month customers to switch to longer-term plans.
3. **Enhanced Service Bundles:** Create value-added bundles for internet and streaming services to reduce dissatisfaction.
4. **Proactive Onboarding:** Engage new customers early through personalized onboarding and support programs.
5. **Flexible Payment Options:** Introduce modern and flexible payment methods to address dissatisfaction among electronic check users.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** for data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Tableau** for creating visualizations and dashboards.
- **Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn** for EDA.

## Conclusion
This analysis emphasizes the importance of adopting targeted retention strategies to mitigate customer churn in the telecom industry. By addressing the needs of high-risk segments—such as senior citizens, month-to-month contract holders, and new customers—companies can significantly reduce churn rates and foster long-term loyalty.
Key opportunities include promoting longer-term contracts, enhancing bundled service offerings, proactively engaging digital-first and new customers, and introducing flexible payment options. Implementing these recommendations can lead to improved customer satisfaction, reduced churn, and sustained business growth.
