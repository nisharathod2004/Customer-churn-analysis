## Key Findings
- **Demographics:** Senior citizens exhibit a significantly higher churn rate (42%).
- **Contract Types:** Month-to-month contracts have the highest churn rate (43%) compared to one-year (11%) and two-year contracts (3%).
- **Service Usage:** Fiber-optic internet and streaming services correlate with elevated churn rates.
- **Billing Preferences:** Electronic billing and electronic check payments show higher churn rates.
- **Tenure:** New customers (tenure < 12 months) are at the highest risk of churning.

## Recommendations
1. **Customer Segmentation:** Develop targeted retention strategies for high-risk groups, such as senior citizens and month-to-month contract holders.
2. **Incentivize Long-Term Contracts:** Offer promotions to encourage month-to-month customers to switch to longer-term plans.
3. **Enhanced Service Bundles:** Create value-added bundles for internet and streaming services to reduce dissatisfaction.
4. **Proactive Onboarding:** Engage new customers early through personalized onboarding and support programs.
5. **Flexible Payment Options:** Introduce modern and flexible payment methods to address dissatisfaction among electronic check users.

## Conclusion
This analysis emphasizes the importance of adopting targeted retention strategies to mitigate customer churn in the telecom industry. By addressing the needs of high-risk segments—such as senior citizens, month-to-month contract holders, and new customers—companies can significantly reduce churn rates and foster long-term loyalty.
Key opportunities include promoting longer-term contracts, enhancing bundled service offerings, proactively engaging digital-first and new customers, and introducing flexible payment options. Implementing these recommendations can lead to improved customer satisfaction, reduced churn, and sustained business growth.
